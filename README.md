# Caesar Cipher (Rot-13) Written in Assembly

A simple rot-13 program developed with assembly language.

Although currently the program only supports encryption key being 13, but it can be easily tweaked to support any encryption key to make it a full Caesar Cipher program.

## Compilation

The [SASM IDE](https://dman95.github.io/SASM/english.html) is used in developing, building, and executing the rot-13 assembly program.

For simplicity, download and install SASM to continue development and build the program.

```
